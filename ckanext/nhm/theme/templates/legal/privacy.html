    <p>When you visit <a href="http://www.data.nhm.ac.uk/">data.nhm.ac.uk</a> we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site, to compile statistical reports on website activity and to personalise our visitors’ experiences of using the site.</p>
    <p>Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect this information. You can set your browser not to accept cookies and remove cookies from your browser. However in a few cases some of our website features may not function as a result. You can read more about how we use cookies and how to disable cookies on our <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/website-help/terms-of-use/cookies/index.html">Information about cookies page</a>.</p>
    <p>If we do want to collect personally identifiable information via the website or other digital channels, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.</p>
    <p>This privacy notice does not cover links to external websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit.</p>

    <h3>People who use and support our services</h3>
    <p>The main purposes for which we collect and process the details of customers, visitors, members, service users, enquirers, donors and potential donors are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to provide the service, goods or information that they have requested</li>
        <li>for administration purposes e.g. to administer donations</li>
        <li>to further our charitable aims, including fundraising activities</li>
        <li>to gather feedback</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also hold and analyse your data in order to continue to improve our understanding of our target audiences and of our supporters. This is with a view to providing world class, transformative, visitor-focused experiences, customer service and educational engagement, and to look at ways in which we might in the future use the latest technologies to improve and personalise the services that we offer. As part of this, we may analyse personal information collected from you, and occasionally from third parties, to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information.</p>
    <p>We may use your data to contact you from time to time by post, email, phone and/or SMS with news and information about the Museum that we feel may be of interest to you, such as research, education and fundraising, and about our other events, activities, products and services. We will not use your personal information for such marketing purposes if you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted.</p>
    <p>When you subscribe to our services or give consent to receiving news and information from us, you can cancel your subscription, withdraw your consent to being contacted or change your preferred method of contact at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@nhm.ac.uk">unsubscribe@nhm.ac.uk</a>.</p>
    <p>We will not share personal data with third party organisations for marketing purposes, but may occasionally outsource functions when we do not have the in-house capacity required, such as the use of a mailing house for mailings, and analytical services that enable us to target our communications with customers and supporters more effectively. In such cases we will only use reputable and well vetted firms and have contracts and processes in place that ensure the safe and confidential processing of personal data at all times. We may also disclose personal information where required or otherwise permitted by law. We will always ensure an adequate level of protection is provided for personal information transferred outside the European Economic Area.</p>
    <p>We occasionally share data with the Natural History Development Trust, a dedicated independent fundraising trust, and The International Friends of the Natural History Museum, a foundation run by a board of trustees and a registered 501(c)3 organisation encouraging tax-deductible gifts under US law. These organisations are subject to strict agreements with the Museum that ensure that they meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal data.</p>

    <h3>Job applicants, volunteers, current and former Museum employees</h3>
    <p>If you apply to work at the Museum, we will use the information you supply to us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing you beforehand unless the disclosure is required or otherwise permitted by law.</p>
    <p>Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed. We retain de-personalised statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from that data.</p>
    <p>Once you have taken up employment with the Museum, we will compile a file relating to your employment. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will be used for purposes relevant to your employment. Once your employment with the Museum has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention schedule.</p>

    <h3>Access to personal information and correction</h3>
    <p>We strive at all times to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date.
