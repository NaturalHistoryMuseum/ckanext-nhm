<p>The Natural History Museum is committed to open access and open science, and has launched the Data Portal to make its research and collections datasets available online. It allows anyone to explore, download and reuse the data for their own research.</p>

<h4>Museum collection</h4>

<p>Our natural history collection is one of the most important in the world, documenting 4.5 billion years of life, the Earth and the solar system.  Almost all animal, plant, mineral and fossil groups are represented.</p>
<p>The portal's main dataset consists of specimens from the Museum's collection database, with <a href="{{ h.url_for_collection_view() }}">{{ h.delimit_number(collection_stats['total']) }}</a> records from the Museumâ€™s

{% for key, collection_code in h.enumerate(collection_codes) %}
    {% set dept = h.get_department(collection_code) %}
    <a title="{{ dept }} specimens" href="{{ h.url_for_collection_view(collectionCode=collection_code) }}">{{ dept }}</a>{% if key == (collection_codes.__len__() - 2) %} and {% elif key < (collection_codes.__len__() - 2) %}, {% endif %}
{%  endfor %}

collections.
<p>We also have <a title="Index lots" href="{{ h.url_for_indexlot_view() }}">{{ h.indexlot_count() }} species-level</a> (index lot) records, which denote the presence of a taxon in the Museum collection.</p>
<p>These datasets will increase exponentially: Under the Museum's ambitious digital collections programme, we aim to have 20 million specimens digitised in the next five years.</p>

<h4>Research datasets</h4>
<p>The Museum has over 600 curators, researchers, scientific associates, students and volunteers. Our scientists generate over 1,000 scientific papers published annually and datasets from these publications will be available through the portal.</p>

<h4>Help us improve our collection</h4>
<p>Digitising and databasing our vast collections is a huge and evolving task.  As a result some records on the Data Portal may contain erroneous data.  If you do find a record that needs correcting, please tell us about it at <a href="mailto:data@nhm.ac.uk">data@nhm.ac.uk</a>.</p>
