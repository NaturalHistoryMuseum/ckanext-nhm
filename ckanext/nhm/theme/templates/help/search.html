        <h3>What is integrated search?</h3>
        <p>
            The Data Portal hosts many different datasets. The largest and most commonly used is our
            <a href="{{ url_for('dataset.read', id='collection-specimens') }}">Specimens Collection
            </a>
            , but there are {{ h.SI_number_span(stats.dataset_count - 1) }} others. Previously, you
            could only search in one resource (one file within a dataset) at a time, but integrated
            search allows you to search <em>multiple</em> resources at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've also made the search a lot more powerful by adding advanced features such as
            boolean logic (AND, OR, and NOT) and number-based range queries (greater than, less
            than), with more planned in the future. </p>

        <h3>The old search</h3>
        <p>If you still want to use the old search, we haven't removed anything. Just view the
            resource you want to search in and everything should be exactly the same as before.</p>

        <h2>2. Constructing a search</h2>
        <h3>2.1. Selecting resources</h3>
        <p>The integrated search can search across multiple resources (individual sets of records
            within datasets) simultaneously.</p>
        <p>
            Clicking on <b>Resources</b>
            <i class="fas fa-list"></i>
            will bring up a dialog similar to this one:
        </p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-resources.png"
             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="The resources popup dialog, with three datasets shown. Each dataset contains one resource.">
        <p>To include a resource in your search, tick the box next to its name. You can
            select/deselect all the resources within a dataset by clicking the dataset name in green
            above it, and select/deselect all resources in the list using the "select all" checkbox
            at the top of the list. To deselect everything <em>except</em> the resources in one
            particular dataset, hold the <code>alt</code> key and click the dataset name.
        </p>
        <p>
            To dismiss the dialog and save your changes, click outside the box. </p>

        <h3>2.2. Free-text search</h3>
        <p>
            The free-text search box allows you to search all fields in your chosen resource list.
            For example, the free-text search "<em>linnaeus</em>" will find records where "Linnaeus"
            is in <em>scientificName</em> and those where "Linnaeus" is in <em>
            determinationNames</em>.
        </p>

             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="The integrated search UI with 'linnaeus' written in the free-text search field. Six rows of results are shown.">

        <h3>2.3. Filters</h3>
        <p>
            Below the free-text search is the filter builder. <em>Filter</em> can refer to any part
            of this: a whole group of multiple items, or a single item. Each of the smallest items
            are referred to as <em>terms</em>, and they are linked together in <em>groups</em>. For
            example:
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container no-padding">
            <img src="/images/help/search-filters.png"

            <p>There are two <em>terms</em> in this filter: <b>kingdom = animalia</b> and <b>

            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>2.3.1. Filter Terms</h4>
        <p>A <em>term</em> filters on field names (i.e. it will be applied to every field with that
            name in every resource in the query - case-insensitively). Terms are the basic units of
            filtering.
        </p>
        <p>To add a new term, click the
            <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i>
            icon and click "new term". This will bring up the term editor.

        <p>On the left side, select the fields to search in. Typing in the textbox will filter the

            </div>
            <div>
                <p><b>Field type</b> is the data type that the field will be read as. Most queries
                    will use the default "Text" type, but more complex queries may use the "Number"
                    or "Geo" types. A fourth type, "Any", only has one comparison type ("exists")
                    and just checks if the field has any content at all.
                </p>
                <p><b>Comparison type</b> describes how the field value will be compared to the
                    query/comparison value. Each field type has different comparison types
                    available.
                </p>
                <p><b>Comparison value</b> is the value to which the field values will be compared.
                </p>
                <p><b>Display name</b> is entirely optional, but may be useful for especially
                    complex queries with many terms: it allows you to set a "friendly" display name
                    for the term, so it will be shown in a more memorable way.

        <h4>2.3.2. Filter Groups</h4>
        <p><em>Groups</em> allow you to link terms and use some boolean logic in your queries. You
            can have three types of group: AND (aka 'all of'), OR (aka 'any of'), and NOT (aka 'none
            of'). To change the group type, click the name in the top left corner. In the groups
            below, the terms are the same but the group type has changed. This drastically changes
            the records found.

                In the first group, each record must match <em>all of</em> the terms; so each record
                must have collectionCode=BOT <b>and</b> year=2000.
            </li>
            <li>In the second group, each record can match <em>any of</em> the terms; so each record
                must have collectionCode=BOT <b>or</b> year=2000 (or both!).
            </li>
            <li>In the third group, each record must <b>not</b> match any of the terms; so the
                records match neither collectionCode=BOT nor year=2000.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Groups can also be nested under the top level:</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-nested-groups.png"
             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="Two 'all of' groups nested within a 'any of' group. 'All of' group one is searching for 'collectionCode = BOT' and 'year = 2000', while 'all of' group 2 is searching for 'collectionCode = PAL' and 'year = 2008'.">
        <p>This query would search for <em>either</em> botany records from 2000 <em>or</em>
            palaeontology records from 2008.
        </p>
        <p><b>NB</b>: when you're using the user interface, the whole query is wrapped in a hidden

        <h4>2.3.3. Presets</h4>
        <p><em>Presets</em> are predefined filter terms that are commonly used and/or need to be
            dynamically set. There are currently very few of these, but more can be added later.
            Please {% link_for _('contact us'), named_route='contact.form' %} if you need one of
            these presets added.
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of presets: static and dynamic. These are both found in the same
            place, so the difference is explained here for interest/clarity's sake more than
            anything else.</p>
        <p>A <em>static</em> preset contains the same information every time, e.g. the <em> Birdwing
            Butterfly Digitisation</em> will always add a term where <code>project = Birdwing
            Butterfly Digitisation</code> .
        </p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-presets-birdwing.png"
             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="The term editor for the Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation preset. The project field is selected, the field type is 'text', the comparison type is 'equals', and the comparison value is 'Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation'.">
        <p><em>Dynamic</em> presets change their value dependent on other factors in the query <b>at
            the time they are added</b>. Once added, they act like every other filter term, so try
            to add these last if possible. An example is the <em>Has Image</em> preset, which
            extracts image fields from the current list of resources and adds an
            "<code>exists</code>" term that checks if these fields have content in them.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container flex-equal flex-top">
            <div>
                <img src="/images/help/search-presets-hasimage-1.png"
                     class="img-responsive help-img"
                     alt="The term editor for the Has Image preset. Two fields are selected: media and associatedMedia. The field type is 'any' and the comparison type is 'exists'.">
                <p>
                    In this example, multiple resources with an image field are being searched, so
                    multiple image fields are added to the term. Not every resource will have an
                    image field set, and those that do may share field names with other resources,
                    so the list is likely to be much shorter than the actual list of resources.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="/images/help/search-presets-hasimage-2.png"
                     class="img-responsive help-img"
                     alt="The term editor for the Has Image preset. Only one field is selected: associatedMedia. The field type is 'any' and the comparison type is 'exists'.">
                <p>In contrast to the previous image, in this example only one resource with an
                    image field is being searched (or, all the resources being searched have the
                    same image field name), so only one field is selected.</p>

        <h2>3. Results</h2>
        <h3>3.1. Views</h3>
        <p>
            The results of a search can be displayed in different ways, termed "views". To change
            the <em>view</em>, click the name of the view above the results (see <em>Result View
            Switcher</em> in <b>1. UI Overview</b>).
        </p>
        <p>The fields shown in some views (i.e. Table and List) are dynamically selected via an API
            method that attempts to guess the "most relevant" fields.</p>
        <h4>3.1.1. Table View</h4>
        <p>The table view is the default view. It displays the results in tabular form.</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-results-table.png"
             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="Labelled screenshot of the table results view.">
        <h4>3.1.2. List View</h4>
        <p>The list view displays a short summary of each record individually, along with thumbnails
            of any associated images (if there are any).</p>
        <p>Clicking on an image brings up the viewer overlay, which displays a larger version and
            offers an option to download the image.</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-results-list.png"
             class="img-responsive help-img"
             alt="Labelled screenshot of the list results view.">
        <h4>3.1.2. Gallery View</h4>
        <p>The gallery view displays all the images associated with records in the search. It does
            not show records separately, but simply lists out all available images for each page of
            results.</p>
        <p>Clicking on an image brings up the viewer overlay, which displays a larger version and
            offers an option to download the image.</p>

        <h4>3.2.1. Cite</h4>
        <p>The <em>cite</em> button generates a digital object identifier (DOI) for the search,
            allowing you to easily cite the results in publications.</p>
        <h4>3.2.2. Share</h4>
        <p>Similarly to the cite button, the <em>share</em> button also generates a link to the
            search; but it is intended for more informal use, such as when sharing a search with a
            colleague. It uses three random words to create a memorable short link (with the option
            to include the page and view) that can then be shared.</p>

        <h4>3.2.3. Download</h4>
        <p>The download button allows you to request a full download of the set of results in CSV
            format. The record data will be automatically packaged up and sent to your email address
            when ready.</p>
