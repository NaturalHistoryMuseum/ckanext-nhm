        <h4>What is integrated search?</h4>
        <p>
            The Data Portal hosts many different datasets. The largest and most commonly used is our
            <a href="{{ url_for('dataset.read', id='collection-specimens') }}">Specimens
                                                                               Collection</a>, but
            there are {{ h.SI_number_span(stats.dataset_count - 1) }} more. Previously, you could
            only search in one resource (one file within a dataset) at a time, but integrated search
            allows you to search <em>multiple</em> resources at the same time. </p>
        <p>
            We've also made the search a lot more powerful by adding advanced features such as
            boolean logic (AND, OR, and NOT) and number-based range queries (greater than, less
            than), with more planned in the future. </p>

        <h4>The old search</h4>
        <p>If you still want to use the old search, we haven't removed anything. Just view the
           resource you want to search in and everything should be exactly the same as before.</p>

        <h4>Selecting resources</h4>
        <p>
            Clicking on <b>Resources</b> <i class="fas fa-list"></i> will bring up a dialog similar
            to this one:</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-resources.png" class="img-responsive">
        <p>To include a resource in your search, tick the box next to its name. You can
           select/deselect all the resources within a dataset by clicking the dataset name in green
           above it, and select/deselect all resources in the list using the "select all" checkbox
           at the top of the list. </p>
        <p>
            To dismiss the dialog and save your changes, click outside the box. </p>

        <h4>Free-text search</h4>
        <p>
            The free-text search box allows you to search all fields in your chosen resource list.
            For example, the free-text search "<em>linnaeus</em>" will find records where "Linnaeus"
            is in <em>scientificName</em> and those where "Linnaeus" is in
            <em>determinationNames</em>. </p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-freetext.png"
             class="img-responsive"
             alt="The integrated search UI with 'linnaeus' written in the free-text search field. Six rows of results are shown.">

        <h4>Filters: Terms + Groups</h4>
        <p>
            Below the free-text search is the filter builder. <em>Filter</em> can refer to any part
            of this: a whole group of multiple items, or a single item. Each of the smallest items
            are referred to as <em>terms</em>, and they are linked together in <em>groups</em>. For
            example:</p>
        <div class="flex-container no-padding">
            <img src="/images/help/search-filters.png"
                 class="img-responsive"
                 alt="Two terms (kingdom=animalia and collectionCode=zoo) grouped together in a green box. The words 'all of' are in the top right corner.">
            <p>There are two <em>terms</em> in this filter: <b>kingdom = animalia</b> and <b>collectionCode
                                                                                             =
                                                                                             zoo</b>.
               They are linked together in an AND (all) <em>group</em>.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Groups</h4>
        <p>Groups allow you to use some boolean logic in your queries. You can have three types of
           group: AND (aka 'all of'), OR (aka 'any of'), and NOT (aka 'none of'). To change the
           group type, click the name in the top left corner. In the groups below, the terms are the
           same but the group type has changed. This drastically changes the records found.</p>
        <div class="flex-container flex-top">
            <img src="/images/help/search-groups-and.png" class="img-responsive">
            <img src="/images/help/search-groups-or.png" class="img-responsive">
            <img src="/images/help/search-groups-not.png" class="img-responsive">
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In the first group, each record must match <em>all of</em> the terms; so each record
                must have collectionCode=BOT <b>and</b> year=2000.
            </li>
            <li>In the second group, each record can match <em>any of</em> the terms; so each record
                must have collectionCode=BOT <b>or</b> year=2000 (or both!).
            </li>
            <li>In the third group, each record must <b>not</b> match any of the terms; so the
                records match neither collectionCode=BOT nor year=2000.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Groups can also be nested under the top level:</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-nested-groups.png" class="img-responsive">
        <p>This query would search for <em>either</em> botany records from 2000 <em>or</em>
           palaeontology records from 2008.</p>

        <h4>Terms</h4>
        <p>To add a new term, click the <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> symbol at the right hand
           side of a group.</p>
        <img src="/images/help/search-empty-filter.png" class="img-responsive">
        <p>This will bring up the term editor.</p>

                <p>On the left side, select the fields to search in. You can use the textbox to
                   search the list of fields. Double click a field name to add it to the query.</p>
