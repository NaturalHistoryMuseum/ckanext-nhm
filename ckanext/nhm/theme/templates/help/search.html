    <h3>What is integrated search?</h3>
    <p>
        The Data Portal hosts many different datasets. The largest and most commonly
        used is our
        <a href="{{ url_for('dataset.read', id='collection-specimens') }}"
            >Specimens Collection
        </a>
        , but there are {{ h.SI_number_span(stats.dataset_count - 1) }} others.
        Previously, you could only search in one resource (one file within a dataset) at
        a time, but integrated search allows you to search <em>multiple</em> resources
        at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've also made the search a lot more powerful by adding advanced features such
        as boolean logic (AND, OR, and NOT) and number-based range queries (greater
        than, less than), with more planned in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>The old search</h3>
    <p>
        If you still want to use the old search, we haven't removed anything. Just view
        the resource you want to search in and everything should be exactly the same as
        before.

    <h2>2. Constructing a search</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Selecting resources</h3>
    <p>
        The integrated search can search across multiple resources (individual sets of
        records within datasets) simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on <b>Resources</b>
        <i class="fas fa-list"></i>
        will bring up a dialog similar to this one:
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-resources.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The resources popup dialog, with three datasets shown. Each dataset contains one resource."
    />
    <p>
        To include a resource in your search, tick the box next to its name. You can
        select/deselect all the resources within a dataset by clicking the dataset name
        in green above it, and select/deselect all resources in the list using the
        "select all" checkbox at the top of the list. To deselect everything
        <em>except</em> the resources in one particular dataset, hold the
        <code>alt</code> key and click the dataset name.
    </p>
    <p>To dismiss the dialog and save your changes, click outside the box.</p>

    <h3>2.2. Free-text search</h3>
    <p>
        The free-text search box allows you to search all fields in your chosen resource
        list. For example, the free-text search "<em>linnaeus</em>" will find records
        where "Linnaeus" is in <em>scientificName</em> and those where "Linnaeus" is in
        <em> determinationNames</em>.
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-freetext.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The integrated search UI with 'linnaeus' written in the free-text search field. Six rows of results are shown."
    />

    <h3>2.3. Filters</h3>
    <p>
        Below the free-text search is the filter builder. <em>Filter</em> can refer to
        any part of this: a whole group of multiple items, or a single item. Each of the
        smallest items are referred to as <em>terms</em>, and they are linked together
        in <em>groups</em>. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container no-padding">
        <img
            src="/images/help/search-filters.png"
            class="img-responsive help-img"
            alt="Two terms (kingdom=animalia and collectionCode=zoo) grouped together in a green box. The words 'all of' are in the top right corner."
        />
        <p>
            There are two <em>terms</em> in this filter: <b>kingdom = animalia</b> and
            <b> collectionCode = zoo</b>. They are linked together in an AND (all)
            <em>group</em>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        To add a filter term or group, click the <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> icon
        in the filter builder, then select the option you need.
    </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>2.3.1. Filter Terms</h4>
    <p>
        A <em>term</em> filters on field names (i.e. it will be applied to every field
        with that name in every resource in the query - case-insensitively). Terms are
        the basic units of filtering.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add a new term, click the
        <i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i>
        icon and click "new term". This will bring up the term editor.
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-term-editor.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The term editor, as it appears when first shown."
    />
    <p>
        On the left side, select the fields to search in. Typing in the textbox will
        filter the list; you can then select a field by clicking on it. To remove a
        field name, click the <i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> icon.
    </p>
    <img

        alt="The left side of the term editor, showing a list of fields filtered by the search term 'collection'. 'collectionCode' has already been selected."
    />

    <p>
        On the right side, specify the details of your query: field type, comparison
        type, and values.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container flex-stretch-last">
        <div style="min-width: 40%; max-width: max-content">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Field type</b> is the data type that the field will be read as. Most
                queries will use the default "Text" type, but more complex queries may
                use the "Number" or "Geo" types. A fourth type, "Any", only has one
                comparison type ("exists") and just checks if the field has any content
                at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Comparison type</b> describes how the field value will be compared to
                the query/comparison value. Each field type has different comparison
                types available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Comparison value</b> is the value to which the field values will be
                compared.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Display name</b> is entirely optional, but may be useful for
                especially complex queries with many terms: it allows you to set a
                "friendly" display name for the term, so it will be shown in a more
                memorable way.

                NB: geo queries <em>do not use field names</em>. They are based on
                longitude and latitude points that are set elsewhere by the resource
                maintainer.

    />

    <h4>2.3.2. Filter Groups</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Groups</em> allow you to link terms and use some boolean logic in your
        queries. You can have three types of group: AND (aka 'all of'), OR (aka 'any
        of'), and NOT (aka 'none of'). To change the group type, click the name in the
        top left corner. In the groups below, the terms are the same but the group type
        has changed. This drastically changes the records found.

    </div>
    <ol>

        <li>
            In the second group, each record can match <em>any of</em> the terms; so

        </li>
        <li>
            In the third group, each record must <b>not</b> match any of the terms; so
            the records match neither collectionCode=BOT nor year=2000.

    />
    <p>
        This query would search for <em>either</em> botany records from 2000 <em>or</em>

    <h4>2.3.3. Presets</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Presets</em> are predefined filter terms that are commonly used and/or need
        to be dynamically set. There are currently very few of these, but more can be
        added later. Please {% link_for _('contact us'), named_route='contact.form' %}
        if you need one of these presets added.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two types of presets: static and dynamic. These are both found in the
        same place.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <em>static</em> preset contains the same information every time, e.g. the
        <em> Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation</em> will always add a term where
        <code>project = Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation</code> .
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-presets-birdwing.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The term editor for the Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation preset. The project field is selected, the field type is 'text', the comparison type is 'equals', and the comparison value is 'Birdwing Butterfly Digitisation'."
    />
    <p>
        <em>Dynamic</em> presets change their value dependent on other factors in the
        query <b>at the time they are added</b>. Once added, they act like every other
        filter term, so try to add these last if possible. An example is the
        <em>Has Image</em> preset, which extracts image fields from the current list of
        resources and adds an "<code>exists</code>" term that checks if these fields
        have content in them.
    </p>
    <div class="flex-container flex-equal flex-top">
        <div>
            <img
                src="/images/help/search-presets-hasimage-1.png"
                class="img-responsive help-img"
                alt="The term editor for the Has Image preset. Two fields are selected: media and associatedMedia. The field type is 'any' and the comparison type is 'exists'."
            />
            <p>
                In this example, multiple resources with an image field are being
                searched, so multiple image fields are added to the term. Not every
                resource will have an image field set, and those that do may share field
                names with other resources, so the list is likely to be much shorter
                than the actual list of resources.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img
                src="/images/help/search-presets-hasimage-2.png"
                class="img-responsive help-img"
                alt="The term editor for the Has Image preset. Only one field is selected: associatedMedia. The field type is 'any' and the comparison type is 'exists'."
            />
            <p>
                In contrast to the previous image, in this example only one resource
                with an image field is being searched (or, all the resources being
                searched have the same image field name), so only one field is selected.

    <h2>3. Results</h2>
    <h3>3.1. Views</h3>
    <p>
        The results of a search can be displayed in different ways, termed "views". To
        change the <em>view</em>, click the name of the view above the results (see
        <em>Result View Switcher</em> in <b>1. UI Overview</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The fields shown are based on your query (e.g. if you search for year < 2000, it
        will show you year first), some standard columns based on user feedback (e.g.
        scientificName, family, typeStatus) and some that are dynamically selected as
        having high relevance. The fields shown can be changed in the table view and
        will also apply to list view; however, they are reset for each new search.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.1. Table View</h4>
    <p>The table view is the default view. It displays the results in tabular form.</p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-table.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="A screenshot of the table results view. There are three buttons at the top left: table, list and gallery. Table is selected. At the top right is a small plus icon. Underneath these is a table with six columns: dataset, resource, record, scientific name, family, and type status. Under the last three column headers there are small buttons (x, arrow left, arrow right). At the left and right sides of the table there are buttons with double left and right arrows."
    />
    <p>
        The first three columns contain links to the dataset, resource, and full details
        of the record. The following columns contain a selection of fields summarising
        the record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Existing columns can be removed by clicking the "x" icon underneath the header
        and moved left or right by clicking the arrow icons. New columns can be added by
        clicking the green plus icon above the table. Note that new columns are added at
        the end of the list and may not be visble without scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
        The table can be scrolled to the left or right by clicking the tall double arrow
        icons at the sides of the table.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.2. List View</h4>
    <p>
        The list view displays a short summary of each record individually, along with
        thumbnails of any associated images (if there are any).
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-list.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="A screenshot of one record from the list results view. The name of the specimen is in large text at the top, with two smaller links next to it for the dataset and resource. Underneath, the record details are on the left side and four images are in a small 2 by 2 grid on the right."
    />
    <p>The item header links to the full record, dataset, and resource.</p>
    <p>
        Clicking on an image brings up the viewer overlay, which displays a larger
        version and offers an option to download the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fields displayed can be changed by going to table view, changing the
        columns, and switching back to list view.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.2. Gallery View</h4>
    <p>
        The gallery view displays all the images associated with records in the search.
        It does not show records separately, but simply lists out all available images
        for each page of results.
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-gallery.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="A screenshot of the gallery results view. At the top left is the total number of results with images, with the number of results on this page and the total number of results underneath. Under this there are three tabs: table, list, and gallery. Gallery is selected. At the top right there are three buttons: cite, share, and download. The rest of the image shows a grid of image thumbnails in three columns. Each thumbnail has a caption (the scientific name of the specimen) at the bottom and a small number indicator at the top right."
    />
    <p>
        Not all records will necessarily have images, so the images displayed may not
        match the records on previous pages. The header details how many records in your
        total result set have available images and are therefore shown in this view.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many records will also have multiple images, so there will often be more than
        100 images on the page although only 100 records are being represented. The
        small number indicator in the top right of each thumbnail shows how many images
        are in the record and which number that item is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on the caption of the image (usually the scientific name of the
        specimen) opens the record.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on an image brings up the viewer overlay, which displays a larger
        version and offers an option to download the image.
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-imageviewer.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="A screenshot of the image viewer overlay. The image is in the center of the screen. At the left and right are double arrow icons. At the top left is the image title. At the top right there are three icons: a plus magnifying icon, a cloud download icon, and an x icon. At the bottom there is a licence link."
    />
    <p>
        The image viewer doesn't currently have any features like zooming or other image
        manipulation. The magnifying glass icon in the top right opens the image in our
        <a href="{{ h.url_for('liv.index') }}">large image viewer</a>, which has all of
        these features.
    </p>
    <p>The image title at the top links to the main record.</p>
    <p>The cloud download icon lets you download the full size original image.</p>
    <p>The left and right arrows cycle through other images on the page.</p>
    <p>The licence information is at the bottom of the viewer.</p>

    <h3>3.2. Buttons</h3>
    <p>These buttons appear at the top of the results view.</p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-buttons.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The three buttons at the top right of the results view: cite, share, and download."
    />
    <h4>3.2.1. Cite</h4>
    <p>
        The <em>cite</em> button generates a digital object identifier (DOI) for the
        search, allowing you to easily cite the results in publications.
    </p>
    <h4>3.2.2. Share</h4>
    <p>
        The <em>share</em> button also generates a link to the search, but it is
        intended for more informal use, such as when sharing a search with a colleague.
        It uses three random words to create a memorable short link (with the option to
        include the view, and page if there are more than 100 results) that can then be
        shared.
    </p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-results-share.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The 'share' button popup, showing a link to data.nhm.ac.uk/search/coyly-sick-earwig."
    />
    <h4>3.2.3. Download</h4>
    <p>The download button allows you to request a full download of the results.</p>
    <img
        src="/images/help/search-download.png"
        class="img-responsive help-img"
        alt="The 'download' popup. There is a form with options for the output file type and an expandable section for advanced options. Under this there is another form with options for the notification. At the bottom there is a button labelled 'Request Download'."
    />
    <p>
        Multiple formats are available, and each can be configured. The default option
        will create a zip of comma-delimited CSV files, one per resource, skipping any
        columns where none of the results have a value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because result sets can be very large, these files may need time to be created.
        By default, the form will ask you for an email address so that you can be
        notified by email when your download is ready, but if you would prefer not to
        provide this then you don't have to. You can also send the notification to a
        webhook endpoint or select no notification. If you choose this option then
        you'll have to make sure you save the URL of the download status page when it
        appears, as this will be the only way for you to access your download.
